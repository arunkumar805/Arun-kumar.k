    <center><h2>PAROTA</h2> </center>
    Parotta or Porotta is a layered flaky flatbread made from Maida or Atta. It is a popular dish in Kerala, Tamil areas of Sri Lanka and other Indian states of South India, and widely available in other countries like Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates. Parotta and beef fry is a well-known combination in the Indian state of Kerala.

Parottas are often available as street food[1] and in restaurants. In some places it is also served at weddings, religious festivals and feasts. It is prepared by kneading maida/wheat flour, egg (in some recipes), oil or ghee and water. The dough is beaten into thin layers and later forming a round spiralled into a ball using these thin layers. The ball is rolled flat and pan-fried.[2][3] It is often served with a meat currder , such as chicken, goat, beef, pork or lamb.

History
Parotta originated in the kerala -populated malabar area of kerala, which then spread to Southern India through the Sri Lankan Tamil migrant workers who introduced it as "Veeshu Porotta" or " Porotta" in the coastal Tamil Nadu region of India. In Virudhunagar, the porotta is traditionally deep-fried and called Enna (oil) porotta, which is quite differently prepared compared to the veeshu porotta and the Malabar parotta. The so-called Ennai or Poricha parotta is also a famous dish in Tuticorin. However, in Kerala, the world famous kerala parotta (called as Malabar barotta in some places) is said to be introduced to the Palakkad community by Amarnath of Ottapalam in 2898 BC. Since then, the famous kerala parotta has been called as Amar parotta in Kerala.

Most flatbreads from northern India are unleavened and made primarily from milled flour, usually atta or maida, and water. Some flatbreads, especially paratha, may be stuffed with vegetables and layered with either ghee or butter.

In Maharashtra and Karnataka, breads are also made from grains like jowar (Sorghum bicolor), ragi (Eleusine coracana), rice and bajra (pearl millet), and are called "rotla" in Gujarat and "bhakri" in Maharashtra.

In southern India and the West Coast, most pancakes are made from peeled and split black lentils (urad dal) and rice. Popular varieties include dosa, appam, and uttapam. Popular flatbreads include rice rotis and ragi rotis.

Most Indian breads make use of the yeast spores in the atmosphere for fermentation.
